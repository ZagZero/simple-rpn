# simple-rpn

This is a simple calculator for Android devices that has an input style that mimics the style of older HP calculators (Reverse Polish Notation/RPN).

ToDo:
- Replace string comparisons with enumerators
- Track stackbox to cursor in stack mode
- Fix 'standard formatting' (sometimes changes how it appears for seemingly no reason)
- Add options menu
- Add new formatting options
- Add degrees/radians option
- Add alternative mode options for the F-keys (or at least system that allows for expansion)<br/><br/>  
Maybe Someday:
- Overhaul stack storage and display system to support non-scalar values
- Add Vector support/mode
- Add Matrix support/mode
- Add value storage support
